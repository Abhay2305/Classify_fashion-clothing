# Classify_fashion-clothing
Convolutional neural network (CNN).Use MNIST Fashion Dataset and create a classifier to classify fashion clothing into categories.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of artificial neural networks that are specially designed to analyze and classify images, videos, and other types of multidimensional data. They are widely used in computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The main idea behind CNNs is to perform convolutions, which are mathematical operations that apply a filter to an image or other input data. The filter slides over the input data and performs a dot product between the filter weights and the input values at each position, producing a new output value. By applying different filters at each layer, the network learns to detect different features in the input data, such as edges, shapes, and textures. CNNs typically consist of several layers that perform different operations on the input data. The most common types of layers are:
